	When a visitor to your site clicks on an ad, that action is referred to as an Ad Click. The following META tag tracks advertising clicks:

	The redirect needs to include the necessary code to generate a hit to the SDC server. You can designate multiple Advertising Clicks using 
	semicolons. Examples:
	<a href="file111.html?WT.ac=CONTENT111">
	<a href="file222.html?WT.ac=CONTENT222">

	advertising space on your web site, for example, you can collect traffic statistics to help determine pricing schedules. An Ad View occurs when a

	<META NAME="WT.mc_id" CONTENT="1X2GG34">

	<meta name="wt.mc_id" content="">
	<!-- Tracking Servers parameter
	If your site is hosted on multiple servers, a server cluster, or a server farm, and you want to evaluate the performance of your load balancer, 
	Webtrends can track page views for each server. To do so, populate the following META tag on all pages on each server: Example:
	<meta name="WT.sv" content="My Server">
	Defines the name of the machine that serves the web page. If you have two servers (Server1 and Server2), you would make two copies of the META 
	tag and designate CONTENT=“Server1” for deployment to pages on the first server and CONTENT=“Server2” for deployment to the same pages on the 
	second server. For a server farm, you can extract the value of the built-in server name and dynamically assign it to the META tag using 
	server-side scripting. Example:
	<meta name="WT.sv" content="Server1">
	<meta name="WT.sv" content="Server2">
	An Ad View occurs when a visitor views a page containing an ad. An ad is a link or graphic that contains an Ad Click parameter in the query 
	portion of it's URL (https://tagbuilder.webtrends.com/Help/Miscellaneous/AdSearch.aspx?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=450&width=650) -->.
	<meta name="wt.sv" content="">
	<!-- Tracking Page Titles
	You may want to modify a page title before sending it to Webtrends in the following cases:
	You are dealing with dynamic content pages identified by URL parameters, and the page title represents the title of the base URL page rather than 
	the dynamic content page.
	Unless you modify the page titles, all pages have the same title in the reports.
	All pages have been assigned the same title, for reasons of style or company policy.
	Even though URLs are displayed in addition to page title, the entire URL cannot be depended upon to distinguish one page from another. Use 
	server-side scripts to change the title to something that reflects the content of the pages so that you can identify them in reports. Next, pass 
	the customized page titles to Webtrends, using the following META tag:
	<META NAME="WT.ti" CONTENT="title">
	Defines the name of the title for this page. -->
